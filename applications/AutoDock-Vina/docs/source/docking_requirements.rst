Software requirements
=====================

For those tutorials, the ADFR software suite, providing a number of software tools for automated docking and peripheral tasks, and the Python package Raccoon-lite, for preparing macrocycle for example, are necessary.

ADFR software suite
-------------------

.. warning::

    macOS users please note that ADFR software suite is NOT working under Catalina (10.15). We will send email to the mailing list if and when ADFR software suite or an alternative will be available for this version of macOS. If you already are using Catalina, we recommend install VirtualBox and running ADFR software suite inside the virtual box.

Thew ADFR software suite was developed in the Sanner lab at the `Center for Computational Structural Biology (CCSB) <https://ccsb.scripps.edu>`_ formerly known as the Molecular Graphics Laboratory (MGL) of The Scripps Research Institute for visualization and analysis of molecular structures. You can find more information about the ADFR software suite installation process here: `https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/downloads <https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/downloads/>`_. The current version contains the following tools for docking:
    
    - ADFR v1.2 and associate scripts
    - AGFR v1.2
    - AutoSite v1.0 and v1.1
    - ADCP v1.0
    - AutoGrid4.2
    - prepare_ligand
    - prepare_receptor

Moreover, the ADFR software suite provides a number of software tools for automated docking and peripheral tasks. These tools are implemented using the Python, C++ and C programming languages and a re-usable component philosophy. To avoid Python packages mismatches we opted to shift ADFR suite with a self-contain Python interpreter that is isolated from the default Python interpreter installed on your computer (except for Windows installations). Details about the implementation and packages provided by the ADFR software suite can be found here: `https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/implementation <https://ccsb.scripps.edu/adfr/implementation/>`_

Meeko
-----

The Python package ``meeko`` is a new type of package developped in the Forli lab also at the `Center for Computational Structural Biology (CCSB) <https://ccsb.scripps.edu>`_.  It provides tools covering other docking aspects not handled by the ADFR software suite. This package provides addtionnal tools for the following docking protocols:

    - Hydrated docking
    - Macrocycles

This new tool can be easily installed with all its depencies using `pip` or `conda` package managers.

**Meeko installation using Conda**:

The `Conda package manager <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_ is included as part of the Anaconda Python distribution, which can be download from `https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/>`_. This is a Python distribution specially designed for scientific applications, with many of the most popular scientific packages preinstalled. Alternatively, you can use `Miniconda <https://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_, which includes only Python itself, plus the Conda package manager.

1. Begin by installing the most recent 64 bit, Python 3.x version of either Anaconda or Miniconda
2. (Optional, but highly suggested) If you want, you can create a dedicated environment for ``meeko`` and ``AutoDock Vina`` packages (see :ref:`installation`):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n vina python=3
    conda activate vina
    conda install -c conda-forge -c ccsb-scripps vina

3. And type the following command

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c ccsb-scripps meeko

**Meeko installation using pip**:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install meeko

If the installation was successful, you should now be able to access to the following command from your terminal by typing:

    - mk_prepare_ligand.py
