* Allow to define --clip5pAdapterSeq with --clipAdapterType CellRanger4 option.
* Implemented --soloCBmatchWLtype ED2 to allow mismatches and one insertion+deletion (edit distance <=2) for --soloType CB_UMI_Complex.
* Implemented Solo BAM tags gx gn: output ';'-separated gene IDs and names for both unique- and multi-gene reads. Note that GX/GN tags are used to output gene ID/name for unique-gene reads.
* Implemented --soloFeatures GeneFull_ExonOverIntron GeneFull_Ex50pAS options which prioritize exonic over intronic overlaps for pre-mRNA counting.
* Added script extras/scripts/soloCountMatrixFromBAM.awk to re-create Solo count matrix from the BAM output.

* Changed Solo summary statistics outputs in Barcodes.stats and Features.stats files.
* Changed Solo BAM tags GX GN behavior: for missing values, "-" is output instead of omitting the tag.
* Changed Solo BAM tags output for multiple --soloFeatures: now the first feature on the list is used for GX,GN,XB,UB tags.
* Changed Solo SJ behavior: it no longer depends on the whether the alignment is concordant to a Gene.
* Fixed a bug that resulted in slightly different solo counts if --soloFeatures Gene and GeneFull were used together with --soloCBmatchWLtype 1MM_multi_pseudocounts option.

**Bug fixes**

STAR 2.6.0a 2018/04/23
======================

Major new features:
-------------------
* Merging and mapping of overlapping paired-end reads with new options --peOverlapNbasesMin and --peOverlapMMp. The developmment of this algorithm was supported by Illumina, Inc. Many thanks to June Snedecor, Xiao Chen, and Felix Schlesinger for their extensive help in developing this feature.

* New SAM attributes in the --outSAMattributes, vG, vA, and vW to report variants overlapping alignments.
* --waspOutputMode option for filtering allele specific alignments. This is re-implementation of the original WASP algorithm by Bryce van de Geijn, Graham McVicker, Yoav Gilad & Jonathan K Pritchard. Please cite the original WASP paper: Nature Methods 12, 1061â1063 (2015), https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3582 . Many thanks to Bryce van de Geijn for fruitful discussions.

* --outSAMtlen option to select the calculation method for the TLEN field in the SAM/BAM files.

* Implemented standard SAM attribute "MC" to output the mate's CIGAR. Add MC to the list of attributes in the --outSAMattribute option.
* Implemented the ability to input the reads from unmapped SAM/BAM file: --readFilesType SAM SE[PE] for single-end [paired-end] reads to read from the SAM file specified, as usual in --readFilesIn. For BAM files, in addition, specify --readFilesCommand samtools view -h .
* Implemented --seedSplitMin option which was previously hardcoded at 12. his will allow mapping of mates shorter than 12nt.
* Implemented --outFilterIntronStrands None option to switch off filtering by strand consistency of junctions.
* Added new scripts extras/scripts/mergeLogFinal.awk,mergeSuperContig.awk,sjMotif.m

* Implemented new SAM attribute 'ch' to mark chimeric aligmments in the BAM file for --chimOutType WithinBAM option.
* Fixed a problem with RNEXT field in the Chimeric.out.sam file: RNEXT now always points to the other mate start.
* Implemented --bamRemoveDuplicatesType UniqueIdenticalNotMulti option, which (unlike the UniqueIdentical optipon) will NOT mark multi-mappers as duplicates.
* For --bamRemoveDuplicatesType UniqueIdentical, the unmmapped reads are no longer marked as duplicates.

STAR 2.5.2b 2016/08/19

STAR 2.5.0a 2015/11/06
======================

**STAR now uses essential c++11 features and requires gcc 4.7.0 or later.**

Major new features:
-------------------
* Implemented on the fly insertion of the extra sequences into the genome indexes.
* Implemented --outSAMmultNmax parameter to limit the number of output alignments for multimappers.
* Implemented --outMultimapperOrder Random option to output multiple alignments in random order.
    This also randomizes the choice of the primary alignment. Parameter --runRNGseed can be used to set the random generator seed.
    With this option, the ordering of multi-mapping alignments of each read, and the choice of the primary alignment will vary from run to run, unless only one thread is used and the seed is kept constant.

Minor new features:
-------------------
* Implemented --outSAMattrIHstart parameter. Setting it to 0 may be required for compatibility with downstream software such as Cufflinks or StringTie.
* Implemented --outSAMfilter KeepOnlyAddedReferences option.
* Implemented --help option - thanks to @yhoogstrate for the code.
* Implemented --alignEndsType Extend3pOfRead1 option for full extension of the 3' end of read 1.
* Implemented --alignSJstitchMismatchNmax option to allow for mismatches around non-canonical junctions.
* Implemented --chimSegmentReadGapMax parameter which defines the maximum gap in the read sequence between chimeric segments. By default it is set to 0 to replicate the behavior of the previous STAR versions.
* Implemented --chimFilter banGenomicN | None options to prohibit or allow the N characters in the vicinity of the chimeric junctions. By default, they are prohibited - the same behavior as in the previous versions.

Bug fixes:
----------
* For STARlong, increased compilation-time max read length to 500000 and max number of exons to 1000
* Fixed a bug which caused problems in some cases of genome generation without annotations.
* Fixed a bug in the --alignEndsType Extend5pOfRead1 option.

Code improvements:
------------------
* Improved compilation flags handling in Makefile - thanks to Christian Krause for the code.
* Improved treatment of the streams and files - thanks to Alex Finkel for the code.
* Merged pull request from Nathan S. Watson-Haigh: Makefile for manual;Travis-CI automated build; Update STAR-Fusion submodule to v0.3.1
* Merged pull request from Alex Finkel to allow 'parameter=value' option formatting, e.g. --runThreadN=8.
